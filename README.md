## About The Project

### ðŸ“– Overview
Nextcloud Connect, formerly known as Pibiapp, is a powerful tool designed to enhance your workflow by seamlessly integrating with Nextcloud. It's crafted for users seeking to broaden their application's functionality, automate data incorporation, and streamline the management of attachments using Nextcloud.

### ðŸŒŸ Key Features
- **Nextcloud Integration:** Store attachments on the Nextcloud server, create application and module-specific folders, manage version history, and share links with corresponding group members.
- **Automated DocType Creation:** Automatically create a new DocType based on the data structure of a file. This feature supports Excel, CSV, JSON, and XML file formats.
- **Redash Dashboard Integration:** View dashboards directly in your application and manage user access.
